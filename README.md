## Dafna Libman

I am an energetic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, currently looking for a role where I can continue to build my programming skills.

I'm a Biotechnology Engineer with experience in Water Treatment. After moving to the UK 7 years ago I've made a career transition and worked in Sales for different tech and software companies. Recently it became clear to me that it's time to go back to the roots and do something that is more technology focused. Coding was something that I always wanted to learn and being surrounded by developers in my previous job I was very inspired and decided to join the intensive 12 weeks Makers bootcamp.

Since January 2020, I have been studying at Makers Academy, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development. I've also learned good coding practices and the gained pairing and team work experiences.

I believe the combination between the skills I've gained at Makers and my communication skills gained while working as a sales professional, will allow me to add value to my next employer quickly. 

## Skills

#### Fast learner 

I am a self starter that have the ability and discipline to learn a new subject by myself. When joining Ravelin, my previous employer I didn't get much training as both the company and the team were very small and still at the stage of building internal processes. I've managed to study about our product quickly to the level where I could have a conversation with prospect clients about the company's machine learning based product, which enabled me to constantly exceed my monthly sales targets.

#### Analytical thinker 

As a Process Engineer at Nirosoft, I developed complex water treatment processes, optimized processes efficiency under clients' requirement. My main achievement was designing a water treatment plant for a paper manufacturing factory in Chile, with a capacity of 165m3/hour at the total value of US$1.15M.
